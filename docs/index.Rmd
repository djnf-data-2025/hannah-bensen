# Story Pitch

*What the story's about:* This story is about the trend in children Blood Lead Levels (BLL) in the last few years across the county and in specific states of interest such as Maryland. 

While BLL levels have generally trended down in the last few decades across the country, thousands of children across all states still suffer from elevated BLL levels.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that even a low blood lead level (BLL) can cause lifelong health effects.Up until 2012, 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (10 µg/dL) was used to indicate that a child’s BLL was of concern. Since then, research has shown that cognitive and behavioral issues can occur in children with BLLs greater than or equal to 5 µg/dL. In 2021, 3.5 ug/dL became the new reference number to identify children who have been exposed to lead and require case management.\

**For the purpose of this pitch, I will consider 5 µg/dL to be the threshold for "elevated" BLL.** 

Despite the fact that many children experience elevated BLL, few states test all children for elevated BLL, leading to holes in the data. However, the state of Maryland implemented a new law in 2015 and 2016 which mandates that all children at 12 months and 24 months must be tested for lead, leading to a noteable increase in the number of children tested. 

*Why now:* Children's health and public health is always newsworthy. Further, federal budget cuts of health monitoring leads to more ambiguity around the causes and impacts of elevated BLL. Maryland's department of the environment webpage, for example - which ostensibly was a place to obtain Maryland's child blood lead level data - is not usable at the moment due to federal budget cuts. 

![Maryland's data warning on their website.](/Users/hannahbensen/code/hannah-bensen/data/data_warning.png)


*Three sources:*
1. The Maryland Department of Environment's Lead Registry Annual Surveillance Report contains data for Maryland on blood lead tests done in the state. Reports go back until at least 2010, if not earlier. [Here](https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/land/LeadPoisoningPrevention/Documents/2023%20MDE%20Lead%20Poisoning%20Prevention%20Program%20Surveillance%20Report.pdf) is the 2023 report.\
2. The Maryland Department of Health released a [2022 Report](https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/OEHFP/EH/Documents/MDLeadTestingEvaluation_122022.pdf) evaluating the policy impact of Maryland's universal childhood blood lead testing requirement. The report also provides useful information on what Maryland is doing to mitigate elevated blood levels, the impact of lead in children, and sources of lead in Maryland (mainly lead paint from pre-1979 homes)\
3.TBD

*Potential Impact:* Elevated BLL levels in children can result in lower IQ, lifetime earnings, and other negative consequences. According to Maryland's department of health report, lead paint is a preventable hazard that is "highly related to historical inequities in housing policy." 

*Things that surprised me/findings:*

The states with the biggest percentage drops in children with BLL above 5 ug/dl from 2017 to 2021 are:\
1. Nevada\
2. New Jersey\
3. Alaska\
4. Wisconsin\
5. Michigan\

The states with the highest percentage of children with elevated BLL in 2021 are:\
1. Rhode Island\
2. New Jersey\
3. Wisconsin\
4. New Hampshire\
5. Connecticut\


It will also be interesting to consider what factors might be driving the decrease in BLL levels in the above timeframe. (I still need to look into this more).\n
**#rsw comment: look at industries that tend to produce lead as a byproduct - petrochemicals: waste incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers. <https://www.epa.gov/lead-air-pollution/basic-information-about-lead-air-pollution#>:\~:text=At%20the%20national%20level%2C%20major,usually%20found%20near%20lead%20smelters.**

*Context:* Generally speaking, the factors driving declining BLL levels in children in states across the country are driven by a combination of successful federal regulations, dedicated state and local prevention programs, improved surveillance and case management, and increased public awareness regarding lead exposure and prevention.

*Visualizations:* I currently have three charts.

-A bar chart showing the states with the biggest percentage decline in the number of children with elevated BLL from 2017 to 2021.\
-A choropleth map showing BLL levels by state.\
-A choropleth map of Maryland showing their 2023 BLL levels of 5 ug/dL and 5-9 ug/dL. This map was made in datawrapper.

Data details: <https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/php/data/national-surveillance-data.html> BLL - Blood Lead Level, SD - Indicates non-zero counts fewer than 6 have been suppressed to protect confidentiality\
† - Partial annual data submission\
\* - Indicates program did not receive childhood lead poisoning prevention funding from CDC\
‡ - Indicates data not currently available\
ǁ - Includes all popluation data in table\
Population estimates data source: CDC NCHS Bridged Race Single Year of Age population (U.S. Census Populations With Bridged Race Categories <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm#data>).\
- For years 2017-2019, the data use each respective Vintage year for the denominator data (e.g., 2017 data uses the 2017 Vintage bridged race postcensal population estimates).\
- For years 2020-2021, due to data availability at the time of processing, Vintage 2020 was used for data years 2020 and 2021.\
- This will be updated with future data updates to align with pre-2020 years (e.g., 2021 data will use the 2021 Vintage postcensal population estimates, etc.).\
The current Blood Lead Reference Value of 3.5 µg/dL was enacted by CDC in October 2021.
Categorizations of blood lead levels above and below this value will be used in blood lead surveillance tables starting with 2022 data.

From ChatGPT: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), any blood lead level (BLL) of 5 µg/dL or higher is considered elevated and requires public health actions.

Here's a summary of the danger zones based on the image and your description:

BLLs ≥5 µg/dL: This is the threshold where lead exposure becomes concerning and may require intervention.
BLLs ≥10 µg/dL: This level indicates more significant lead exposure and is considered dangerous.
BLLs 5-9 µg/dL: While lower than 10 µg/dL, this range is still concerning and above the CDC's reference level.
BLLs 10-14 µg/dL: This is a dangerous zone and indicates elevated lead exposure.
BLLs 15-19 µg/dL: This level is considered dangerous and requires intervention.
BLLs 20-24 µg/dL: This is a dangerous level of lead exposure.
BLLs 25-44 µg/dL: This is a significantly dangerous level and poses serious health risks.
BLLs ≥45 µg/dL: This is extremely dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.
